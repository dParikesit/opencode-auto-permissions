# OpenCode Stable And V2 Compatibility Spike

These are historical upstream beta notes. This fork additionally supports
released V2 through a server-owned permission evaluation hook, tested without
a TUI on OpenCode `2.0.1`. See [Testing](TESTING.md#released-v2-desktopweb-check-no-tui)
for the current packed-plugin integration test. The beta session/event
measurements below do not describe the native V2 stateless reviewer.

Verified on 4 August 2026 against:

- OpenCode `0.0.0-beta-202608040144`
- `@opencode-ai/plugin@0.0.0-beta-202608040144`
- `@opencode-ai/sdk@0.0.0-beta-202608040144`
- OpenAI-compatible GPT-5.6 Luna reviewer model

Stable compatibility was additionally verified on 5 August 2026 against
OpenCode `1.18.12`.

## Proven

- A Git package can expose separate `./server` and `./tui` entrypoints.
- The transitional beta server loader accepts the legacy `{ server() }` module
  envelope; the package also exports the newer `id/setup` shape.
- The server plugin registers a hidden reviewer agent with wildcard-deny
  permissions and no ordinary tools.
- Permission events use `permission.v2.asked` and
  `permission.v2.replied` with action, resources, and tool provenance.
- V2 session-scoped permission replies work. A live smoke test moved from one
  pending permission to zero.
- Luna returns a decision through OpenCode's `json_schema` structured-output
  contract. The plugin accepts only `info.structured` and never parses fallback
  text.
- The synthetic `StructuredOutput` tool is the only capability re-allowed over
  the reviewer's wildcard deny.
- Reviewer sessions run in an isolated temporary location and are deleted in
  `finally`. Live smoke tests left zero child sessions.
- Human/other-client replies cancel in-flight reviews, and late replies treat
  `404` as a benign lost race.
- Deterministic policy handles routine local commands and hard-risk categories
  before model review.
- Stable `permission.asked`/`permission.updated` and V2
  `permission.v2.asked` protocols are selected automatically by event
  namespace; no user-facing runtime flag is required.
- A live stable shell turn logged an `ask`, completed `git status --short`
  without human input, and ended with zero pending permissions.
- A live stable Luna review blocked a prohibited shell command and ended with
  zero pending permissions.
- Complete real-TUI runs passed on both stable and V2: `git status --short`
  resolved automatically, while an explicitly prohibited `touch` command was
  rejected and did not create its target file.

## Measurements

The first implementation inherited the normal coding-agent context:

- approximately 8,100 input tokens per review;
- approximately 2.6 seconds warm latency;
- approximately 6 seconds including cold location startup.

Reviewer-only system isolation reduced the warm request to:

- 1,594 input tokens;
- 59 output tokens;
- approximately 2.0 seconds model latency.

Cold end-to-end review remains approximately 6 seconds in this beta because
location services and globally discovered skills initialize before the first
request. The plugin now performs best-effort, no-model prewarming and uses an
eight-second timeout. Further latency work is required before claiming the
target sub-1.5-second P95 UX.

## Beta Inconsistencies Handled

- The published plugin declarations and runtime loader use different plugin
  module generations. The package exports both supported shapes.
- `/api/generate` and session transient-generation routes appear in nearby V2
  source but are not registered in this binary. The spike uses an isolated
  legacy session prompt instead.
- `session.wait` is present but returns `503` in this binary.
- Agent wildcard permission keys work through the runtime schema but are
  missing from generated TypeScript declarations.
- `retryCount` is accepted in the structured-output request, but this beta
  reports structured-output failures with `retries: 0`. The plugin fails to
  automatic rejection rather than parsing malformed model text.
- The pinned beta emits transitional `permission.asked` events and stores them
  in the legacy queue even when the V2 TUI owns review. The adapter claims those
  events and falls back to the legacy reply endpoint only after a session-scoped
  V2 `PermissionNotFoundError`.
- The stable SDK has no health/version endpoint. Runtime ownership is learned
  from version-bearing session events and is not cached until detection
  succeeds.
- Current V2 builds (September 2026 and later) renamed the permission events
  back to `permission.asked`/`permission.replied` with flat payloads and
  renamed the reusable-pattern field from `always` to `save`. The adapter
  accepts both field names and both event names.
- V2 does not surface a permission reject message to the coding agent. After
  replying `reject`, the TUI adapter admits a durable user prompt carrying
  the block reason and safer-continuation guidance into the main thread,
  mirroring the stable adapter's `promptAsync` resume. While the agent loop is
  still running the prompt is delivered with `delivery: "steer"` so the
  feedback lands mid-turn; once idle it is admitted with `resume: true`.
  Resume outcomes are recorded as `resumed`/`resume_failed` diagnostics.
